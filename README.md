# VBA-Challenge

# This repository contains a program written for VBA that compiles and analyzes stock market data from a spreadsheet containing multiple worksheets.

# The data is summarized for each stock for the year: annual change of price from open to close, percent change of price, and total stock volume.

# An analysis of the stock with the greatest increase, greatest decrease, and greatest volume is also provided.

# Screenshots of the data summary are included for test data.
